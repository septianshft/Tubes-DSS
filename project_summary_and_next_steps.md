# Project Summary, Milestones, and Next Steps

## Recent Changes & Milestones:

1.  **Database Seeders Modified:**
    *   Commented out `ScholarshipBatchSeeder::class`, `StudentSeeder::class`, and `StudentSubmissionSeeder::class` in `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`. This allows for controlled manual data creation for testing.
2.  **"My Submissions" Page (Teacher View) Fixes:**
    *   In `resources/views/livewire/teacher/submissions/list-submissions.blade.php`:
        *   Corrected student name display from `{{ $submission->user->name }}` to `{{ $submission->student->name }}`.
    *   In `app/Livewire/Teacher/Submissions/CreateStudentSubmissionForBatch.php`:
        *   Added `submission_date => now()` to the `StudentSubmission::create()` call to ensure the "Submitted At" field is populated.
3.  **DSS Score "N/A" Diagnosis & Root Cause Identified:**
    *   Analysis of `storage/logs/laravel.log` confirmed that `criteria_config` for scholarship batches (specifically Batch ID 1) was missing the required `id` field for one or more criteria (e.g., "class_attendance_percentage", "average_score"). This is the primary blocker for DSS calculations.
4.  **Teacher Dashboard Enhancements & Debugging:**
    *   Investigated and resolved slow loading issues on the Teacher Dashboard.
    *   Added a "Rejected Submissions Count" to the Teacher Dashboard component and view.
5.  **DSS & System Architecture Explanation:**
    *   Detailed explanation of the SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) method used in `SAWCalculatorService.php`.
    *   Clarified how Admins define criteria for scholarship batches via `CreateScholarshipBatch.php` and its view.
6.  **Documentation & System Understanding:**
    *   Generated PlantUML ERD structure for the database with a plain-language explanation.
    *   Reviewed existing migration files and confirmed their necessity.
    *   Generated PlantUML Use Case diagram with a plain-language explanation.
7.  **Project Summary Document Updated:**
    *   The `project_summary_and_next_steps.md` file was updated to reflect progress as of May 19, 2025.

## Next Moves (Immediate Priorities):

1.  **USER ACTION: Fix `criteria_config` in Scholarship Batches:**
    *   **Action:** Manually edit the `criteria_config` JSON data for your existing scholarship batches directly in the `scholarship_batches` table in your database.
    *   **Key fields for each criterion object within `criteria_config`:**
        *   `"id"`: **(Crucial - this was missing)** Unique string identifier (e.g., `"c1"`, `"avg_score"`).
        *   `"name"`: Descriptive name.
        *   `"weight"`: Numeric weight.
        *   `"type"`: `"benefit"` or `"cost"`.
        *   `"data_type"`: `"numeric"`, `"qualitative_option"`, or `"qualitative_text"`.
        *   If `data_type` is qualitative, ensure a `value_map` (text to numeric score) or an `options` array (where each option has a `numeric_value`) is present.
2.  **Test DSS Calculation & Rank Display:**
    *   After correcting `criteria_config`, thoroughly test DSS score and rank display in:
        *   Admin's "View Submissions" (`app/Livewire/Admin/Submissions/ViewSubmissions.php` & its Blade view).
        *   Admin's "Show Submission" (`app/Livewire/Admin/Submissions/ShowSubmission.php` & its Blade view).
3.  **Test Core Teacher Functionality:**
    *   Thoroughly test "Add New Student".
    *   Thoroughly test "Submit Student for Scholarship Batch" (validation, prefilling, duplicate prevention, `criteria_values` storage).
4.  **Address Admin Login Redirection Issue:**
    *   Investigate and fix the Admin login redirection problem (related to `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`).

## Suspended/Future Moves (After current issues are resolved):

*   Implement file upload functionality for student submissions and display in admin view.
*   Implement teacher ability to edit existing student data.
*   Implement admin ability to add custom notes when requesting submission revisions.
