# Development Progress Documentation
**Scholarship Management System - Laravel/Livewire Application**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **Scholarship Management System** built with **Laravel 12** and **Livewire 3** that implements a **Decision Support System (DSS)** using the **Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)** method for scholarship recipient selection.

### System Actors
- **Admin**: Manages scholarship batches, users, and system configuration
- **Teacher**: Manages students and submits them for scholarships
- **Student**: Views their scholarship application status and profile

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
users (id, name, email, password, role, ...)
students (id, teacher_id, name, nisn, email, phone, address, date_of_birth, 
         extracurricular_position, extracurricular_activeness, 
         class_attendance_percentage, average_score, tuition_payment_delays, ...)
scholarship_batches (id, name, description, start_date, end_date, quota, is_active, ...)
student_submissions (id, student_id, scholarship_batch_id, submission_date, 
                    status, saw_score, rank_position, ...)
```

### Key Relationships
- `users.id` → `students.teacher_id` (One teacher has many students)
- `students.id` → `student_submissions.student_id` (One student has many submissions)
- `scholarship_batches.id` → `student_submissions.scholarship_batch_id`

## ✅ **Recent Accomplishments**

### 🎯 **Phase 5: Results & Rankings Management (COMPLETED)**
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented comprehensive results management system with full test coverage.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **SAW-based Rankings**: Automatic ranking generation based on calculated scores
- ✅ **Statistical Dashboard**: Real-time statistics including counts, scores, quota tracking
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Auto-approve top candidates, bulk approve/reject with quota enforcement
- ✅ **Advanced Filtering**: Status-based filtering (pending, approved, rejected)
- ✅ **Selection Management**: Select all, clear selection, toggle individual selections
- ✅ **Score Refresh**: Recalculate all SAW scores and update rankings
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 14/14 test cases covering all functionality and edge cases

**Implementation Highlights**:
```php
// ScholarshipResults.php - Core functionality
- autoApproveTopCandidates(): Quota-based auto-approval
- bulkUpdateStatus(): Mass status updates with validation
- refreshScores(): Batch-wide SAW score recalculation
- calculateStatistics(): Real-time dashboard metrics
```

**Database Enhancements**:
- ✅ **Added quota column** to scholarship_batches table
- ✅ **Enhanced factories** with intelligent fallback logic
- ✅ **Fixed test infrastructure** with proper data structure alignment

### 🎯 **Phase 4: Teacher Submission Interface (COMPLETED)**
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented teacher interface for student scholarship submissions.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Student Selection Interface**: Multi-student selection with search functionality
- ✅ **Dynamic Criteria Input**: Context-aware form fields based on batch configuration
- ✅ **Submission Validation**: Comprehensive validation with duplicate prevention
- ✅ **Authorization Checks**: Teacher can only submit their own students
- ✅ **SAW Integration**: Automatic score calculation upon submission

### 🎯 **SAW Calculator Implementation (COMPLETED)**
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented and tested the core SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) calculation system.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Benefit Criteria Normalization**: `(value - min) / (max - min)` 
- ✅ **Cost Criteria Normalization**: `(max - value) / (max - min)`
- ✅ **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - When `min = max` and `value > 0`: returns 1.0 for benefit, 1.0 for cost
  - When `min = max = 0`: returns 0.0 for benefit, 0.0 for cost
  - Handles null/missing criteria gracefully
- ✅ **Multi-criteria Support**: Weighted combination of multiple criteria
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Works with Student model attributes and StudentSubmission normalization
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 15 test cases covering all scenarios

**Implementation Details**:
```php
// Core calculation in SAWCalculatorService.php
public function calculateScore(Student $student, ScholarshipBatch $batch): float
{
    // 1. Get criteria config from batch
    // 2. Prepare min/max values from all submitted students  
    // 3. Normalize each criterion based on type (benefit/cost)
    // 4. Apply weights and sum for final SAW score
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### SAW Algorithm Implementation
The Simple Additive Weighting method calculates scores using:
```
SAW Score = Σ(weight_i × normalized_value_i)
```

**Criteria Fields** (from students table):
- `extracurricular_activeness` (benefit criteria)
- `class_attendance_percentage` (benefit criteria) 
- `average_score` (benefit criteria)
- `tuition_payment_delays` (cost criteria - lower is better)

### Authorization Pattern
All student operations check ownership:
```php
abort_unless($student->teacher_id === auth()->id(), 403);
```

### Testing Pattern
Using Pest PHP with comprehensive feature tests covering:
- Authorization and ownership validation
- CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Livewire component interactions
- Data validation and integrity

## 🤝 For Other AI Assistants

When working on this project:

1. **Always run tests** after making changes: `php artisan test --filter=EditStudentTest`
2. **Check authorization** for all student operations (teacher ownership)
3. **Follow the phase structure** - don't skip ahead without completing dependencies
4. **Focus on the SAW calculation blocker** as the main priority
5. **Maintain test coverage** for all new features
6. **Use Livewire patterns** for interactive components
7. **Follow Laravel conventions** for models, migrations, and relationships

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Run specific tests
php artisan test --filter=EditStudentTest

# Clear caches if needed
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear

# Check database structure
php artisan migrate:status

# Run all tests
php artisan test
```
